# Security Tools

This directory contains security tools for the PaperDebugger project.

## Files

- **`SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`** - Comprehensive security audit report with findings and recommendations
- **`security-scan.sh`** - Automated security scanner script for ongoing monitoring

## Usage

### Running the Security Scanner

```bash
./security-scan.sh
```

This script scans for:
- Suspicious API key patterns
- Hardcoded secrets and passwords  
- GitHub personal access tokens
- Base64 encoded data blocks
- Weak JWT signing keys
- URLs with embedded credentials
- SSH keys and private keys

### Interpreting Results

The scanner uses color-coded severity levels:
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL/HIGH**: Immediate action required
- ðŸŸ¡ **WARN**: Should be reviewed and addressed
- ðŸ”µ **INFO**: Informational, may need attention

### Recommended Workflow

1. Run the scanner before each release
2. Review all findings manually for context
3. Address high and critical findings immediately
4. Consider adding the scanner to your CI/CD pipeline

### False Positives

The scanner may report false positives. Always review findings manually:
- Configuration templates with placeholders
- Test data or example configurations
- Third-party library code
- Documentation examples

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**: Address critical findings in the audit report
2. **Implement Secret Management**: Use environment variables and secret stores
3. **Automate Scanning**: Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Regular Audits**: Run quarterly security reviews
