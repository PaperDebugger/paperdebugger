Identify the explicit or implicit research question(s) of the paper.

Analysis:
1. Restate each research question in a precise interrogative form.
2. Identify what specific unknown or gap it addresses.
3. Assess whether the question can be answered by the paper’s methods and experiments.
4. Determine whether the question is falsifiable or empirically resolvable.

Revision Suggestions:
Part A - Major / Structural:
- Specify which section(s) should clarify or reformulate the research question.
- Explain what missing elements must be added (e.g., scope, constraints, comparison dimension).
- Indicate whether the paper needs re-scoping to match its actual methods.

Part B - Minor / Text-Level:
- Quote sentences where the research question is vague.
- Suggest concrete rewrites to make the question explicit and specific.

Reviewer Impact Estimation:
- Severity: Critical / Major / Minor
- Affected Dimensions: Novelty, Technical Soundness, Significance, Clarity
